Help for GLINE:

GLINE allows you to maintain network-wide bans.
&nick& will keep your GLINEs stored in a database and allow
for easy management.

Syntax: GLINE ADD <nick|hostmask> [!P|!T <minutes>] <reason>

If the !P token is specified the GLINE will never expire (permanent).
If the !T token is specified expire time must follow, in minutes,
hours ("h"), days ("d") or weeks ("w").

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GLINE ADD foo !T 5 bar reason
    /msg &nick& GLINE ADD foo !T 3d bar reason
    /msg &nick& GLINE ADD foo@bar.com !P foo reason
    /msg &nick& GLINE ADD foo@bar.com foo reason

The first example looks for the user with a nickname of "foo" and adds
a 5 minute GLINE for "bar reason."

The second example is similar but adds the GLINE for 3 days instead of
5 minutes.

The third example adds a permanent GLINE on foo@bar.com for "foo reason."

The fourth example adds a GLINE on foo@bar.com for the duration specified
in the configuration file for "foo reason."

Syntax: GLINE DEL <hostmask|number>

If number is specified it correlates with the number on GLINE LIST.
You may specify multiple numbers by separating with commas.
You may specify a range by using a colon.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GLINE DEL foo@bar.com
    /msg &nick& GLINE DEL 5
    /msg &nick& GLINE DEL 1,2,5,10
    /msg &nick& GLINE DEL 1:5,7,9:11

Syntax: GLINE LIST [FULL]

If FULL is specified the GLINE reasons will be shown.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GLINE LIST
    /msg &nick& GLINE LIST FULL

Syntax: GLINE LIST <hostmask>

Shows any GLINEs matching the given hostmask, with reasons.
This command will not perform DNS lookups on a host,
for best results repeat it with host and IP address.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& GLINE LIST test@192.168.1.1

Syntax: GLINE LIST <number>

Shows the given GLINE, with reason.

Syntax: GLINE SYNC

Sends all GLINEs to all servers. This can be useful in case
services will be down or do not see a user as matching a
certain GLINE.
