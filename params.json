{"name":"Xtheme","tagline":"Xtheme IRC Services (a fork of Atheme)","body":"# Xtheme IRC Services\r\nXtheme is feature-packed, fast, efficient, customisable, extendable and ubiquitous. Xtheme is a leader in revolutionary new features, stability and dependability.\r\n\r\nView our [Xtheme IRC Services on GitHub](http://github.com/IRC4Fun/Xtheme/)\r\n\r\n## Ubiquity\r\nA lot of trusted, stable networks have used Atheme. Networks such as [freenode](http://www.freenode.net/), [EsperNet](http://www.esper.net/) and [DarkMyst](http://darkmyst.org/) are all relying on [Atheme IRC services](http://is-atheme-dead-yet.net/), which **Xtheme** is forked form.\r\n\r\n## Extensible\r\nEven something as featureful as Xtheme might not have everything your network needs. For those cases, Xtheme offers both an extremely clean C API and a powerful, well-structured Perl interface. Extending services has never been easier!\r\n\r\n## Fast + Efficient\r\nThe Internet is faster than ever before. Computers are exponentially speedier than any time in the past. Shouldn’t your IRC services be fast too? Xtheme IRC services not only are lightning fast, but are also the most scalable modern IRC services package available.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\nXtheme supports linking to over fifteen different IRC daemons. Most popularly: [UnrealIRCd](https://www.unrealircd.org/), [Charybdis](http://github.com/atheme/charybdis/), [InspIRCd](http://www.inspircd.org/) and [more](https://github.com/IRC4Fun/Xtheme/tree/master/modules/protocol)!\r\n\r\n## Customisable\r\nXtheme comes prebundled with over 250 modules and you can find over 50 additional modules in our [contributed modules repository](https://github.com/IRC4Fun/xtheme-contrib-modules) on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Feature-Packed\r\nXtheme has all the features you’ve come to expect from modern IRC services, such as BotServ and HostServ, as well as innovative new features, such as GroupServ, ChanFix and InfoServ.  [SWI](http://irc4fun.github.io/SWI/) (Web Panel) is also compatible with Xtheme and most Atheme forks.\r\n\r\n## Friendly Support\r\nYou can always get friendly support on irc.IRC4Fun.net in [#Xtheme](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.irc4fun.net/#Xtheme) or chat.freenode.net in [##Xtheme](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/##Xtheme).\r\n\r\n## Bugs/Feature Requests\r\nPlease report all bugs and/or feature requests on IRC in the appropriate channels as well as the [Issues tracker](http://github.com/IRC4Fun/Xtheme/issues/).\r\n\r\n## IRC\r\nXtheme IRC Services support is available at the following networks: IRC4Fun irc.IRC4Fun.net in [#Xtheme](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.irc4fun.net/#Xtheme) –or– Freenode chat.freenode.net in [##Xtheme](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/##Xtheme).\r\n\r\n## Development\r\nWe’re currently looking for individuals with an interest in Xtheme and IRC development to join the IRC4Fun Development Group, or simply to contribute to Xtheme.
